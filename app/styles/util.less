 * than presentation.

/**
 * ### `util--sr-only`
 * The `util--sr-only` class designates content that
 * is intended only for screen readers and other
 * assistive devices. The content is not normally
 * visible to regular web browsers.

 * content will be hidden (includng from screen

 * static headings for dynamic content).
